# -r 8 = frame rate 8/s

# For extracting images from a video:
#
#                    ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg
#
#            This will extract one video frame per second from the video and
#            will output them in files named foo-001.jpeg, foo-002.jpeg, etc.
#            Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.
#
#            If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use
#            the above command in combination with the "-frames:v" or "-t"
#            option, or in combination with -ss to start extracting from a
#            certain point in time.
